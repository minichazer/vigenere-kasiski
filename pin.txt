He was so thinly dressed that no other man, even a habitual one, would have been willing to go out in such rags during the day. However, the neighborhood was such that it was hard to surprise anyone here with a suit. The proximity of Sennaya Street, the abundance of well-known establishments, and, for the most part, the shop and craft population crowded into these midst St. Petersburg streets and lanes, dotted the general panorama sometimes with such subjects that it would have been strange to be surprised to meet a different figure. But so much malignant contempt had already accumulated in the young man's soul that, in spite of all his, sometimes very young, ticklishness, he was the least ashamed of his rags in the street. It was a different matter when he met other acquaintances or former comrades, whom he did not like to meet... And meanwhile, when one drunken man, who for some unknown reason and where was being carried along the street at this time in a huge cart pulled by a huge crowbar horse, shouted at him suddenly, passing by, "Hey you, German Hatter!" - and shouted at the top of his voice, pointing at him with his hand, - the young man suddenly stopped and frantically grabbed for his hat. This hat was a tall, round, Zimmermann hat, but it was all worn out and very red, full of holes and stains, with no brim and the most ugly angle that had been broken at the side. But it was not shame, but a different feeling, like fright, that seized him.
